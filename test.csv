1617258174,chazzmoney,"Maybe you missed that it was a metaphor for a turnaround. I‚Äôm not calling GameStop a $2 Trillion company. I‚Äôm saying that the current market cap of $13 Billion might not be fairytale land if you think Ryan Cohen is going to pull a Chewy and turn GameStop into the primary online destination for gamers. In my opinion, such a place does not exist. The closest might be Twitch.

I‚Äôm not saying anyone should invest. I‚Äôm not saying it going to $50,000. I am saying that the valuation is not crazy right now if you believe in a turnaround.

Why did I write my original post? Because I saw the same story in the late 1990s that Apple couldn‚Äôt be saved and was going to go bankrupt - they lost the PC wars and had multiple years of losses even after Jobs returned.

Again, not saying GameStop is apple. Just that when predicting the future of GameStop you either believe in the losses or you believe in the turnaround. Your future expectation dictates the price you are willing to pay.

Positions: I üí©  on the GME trade and DD through November 2020. Bought before Christmas 2020. Sold at $350. Bought again at $40. Bought again at $90. Bought again at $120. I like the stock. It is not Apple.","['GME', 'DD']"
